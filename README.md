# README_Generator
Using this readme generator allows for you to create a ReadMe file easily.
The prompt will ask you questions regarding the title, description, uses, how to install, guidelines to use, what license was used, what your github username is, and preferred email.
All asked after typing node index.js into your terminal then your prompts will begin resulting in your new ReadMe!
